# String is a sequence of character
name = 'Abu naim'
name2 = "Abdullah"
name3 = """
    Abu Naim
    Abdullah
"""
print(name3)
# for n in name3:
#     print(n)

# all possible operation as like list for example,
print(name2[::-1])

# But list is mutable, mutable means changeable
# string is immutable, immutable means unchangeable

# name2[0] = 'X' # this is provide a error for immutability
# print(name2)

# if 'Abu' in name:
#     print('Exist')
